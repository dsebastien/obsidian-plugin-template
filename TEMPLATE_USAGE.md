- Modify the plugin name in .github/workflows/release.yml
- Install the project dependencies using Â´npm install`
- Run `npx nx connect` to generate a Nx Cloud access token, add, commit and push the changes. After that, make sure to connect the workspace to your Nx cloud organization
- Grant Read/Write access for workflows (pipelines). Go to https://github.com/<user>/<project>/settings/actions and select "Read and write permissions" under "Workflow permissions"
